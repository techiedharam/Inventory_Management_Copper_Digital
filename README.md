# Inventory Management System Copper Digital

This project is an **Inventory Management System** that enables users to browse a list of products and manage their purchases using a shopping cart. The application is built with React, utilizing **Context API** and **Reducer Function** to handle global state management and cart functionality effectively.

## Features

1. **Product Listing**:
   - Displays a list of available products with details such as name, price, and description.
   - Users can add products to the cart directly from the product list.

2. **Cart Functionality**:
   - View items added to the cart.
   - Update the quantity of products in the cart.
   - Remove items from the cart.
   - Calculate the total price dynamically as items are added or removed.

3. **State Management**:
   - **Context API** is used to provide a global state for managing the cart and product list.
   - **Reducer Function** is implemented to handle state transitions for cart actions (add, update, remove).

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on mobile and desktop.

5. **Styling**:
   - Tailwind CSS is used for efficient and modern styling, ensuring a clean and responsive UI.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Component-based UI library for building the frontend.
- **Context API**: For state management to share data across components.
- **Reducer Function**: To manage complex state transitions in the cart.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing modern and responsive layouts.

## File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/           // Static assets like images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Loading.jsx   // Component for loading state
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Navbar.jsx    // Component for the navigation bar

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CartContextProvider.jsx // Context and reducer for cart functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AllRoutes.jsx   // Routing configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx             // Main application component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css             // Global CSS styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css           // Tailwind CSS configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.jsx            // Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore              // Git ignore file
â”œâ”€â”€ eslint.config.js        // ESLint configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json            // Project dependencies and scripts
```

## How It Works

1. **Product Listing**:
   - Products are fetched from a static array or API and displayed using the `ProductList` component.

2. **Cart Management**:
   - Cart state is maintained globally using the Context API (`CartContextProvider.jsx`).
   - Reducer function is used to handle the following actions:
     - **Add to Cart**: Adds a product to the cart or updates the quantity if the product is already in the cart.
     - **Remove from Cart**: Removes a specific product from the cart.
     - **Update Quantity**: Adjusts the quantity of a product in the cart.

3. **State Flow**:
   - Components consume the context to display and modify the cart state dynamically.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate a backend service for product data and cart persistence.
- Add user authentication to save cart data per user.
- Include product filters and search functionality.
- Add payment gateway integration for checkout.
